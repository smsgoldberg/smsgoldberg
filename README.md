Hi! I'm Sarah, and I'm crazy about information -- seriously! I'm a student in the General Assembly coding bootcamp, where I'm learning to wrangle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Before that, I took a brief foray into the academic study of religion as an undergraduate, and I started my career as an assistant at my hometown library, helping people find their next great beach readone or track down that super niche scholarly text via interlibrary loan! 

On weekends, you can find me playing guitar 🎸, kayaking 🚣, or volunteering with the bunnies 🐇 at my local animal shelter.
